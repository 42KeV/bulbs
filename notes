to do:
    1. insure the user is authorized when doing stuff in the admin panel
    2. fix case sensitive usernames
    3. change how forums are organized. instead of just randomly, sort them from a sorting rank variable in the database. lowest number at top, highest number at bottom
    4. instead of utilizing postgresql's pgcrypto extension, do the encryption in the application, safer and it can be a hassle to setup pgcrypto for noobs (or maybe they are using a shared db or some shit and can't, i know you have to run a custom instance of postgresql on webfaction in order for you to use extensions)

you do not have the pgcrypto extension installed

-- solution = create the pgcrypto extension

 # auto generate an encryption key at installation and store it in a seperate file
